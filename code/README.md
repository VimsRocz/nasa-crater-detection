# Code Directory README

This directory contains the Python scripts essential for the NASA Lunar Crater Detection Challenge.

## Scripts Overview:

### 1. `crater_detector_final.py`
This is the **main application script** for detecting craters. It implements the core computer vision pipeline:
-   **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances raw lunar images.
-   **Edge Detection**: Identifies potential crater boundaries.
-   **Contour Detection**: Extracts shapes from the edges.
-   **Ellipse Fitting**: Fits ellipses to detected contours, representing craters.
-   **Crater Filtering**: Applies contest-specific rules to filter out invalid detections (e.g., too small, too large, or partially visible craters).
-   **Confidence Scoring**: Assesses how likely a detected ellipse is an actual crater.
-   **Dataset Processing**: Capable of processing entire image datasets and outputting results in a structured CSV format.

This script can also generate sample data and includes an evaluation mode to compare its detections against ground truth (though for official scoring, `scorer.py` should be used).

### 2. `analyze_results.py`
This script is used for **post-processing analysis** of the crater detection results generated by `crater_detector_final.py`. It helps in understanding the quality and characteristics of the detected craters by:
-   Providing descriptive statistics for ellipse parameters (e.g., semi-major, semi-minor axes, aspect ratio).
-   Identifying potential outliers or unusual detections, such as ellipses that might be too large or unusually elongated, which could indicate issues with the detection logic or parameters.

It serves as a diagnostic tool to fine-tune the detection parameters.

### 3. `scorer.py`
This is the **official offline scoring script** provided for the NASA Crater Detection Challenge. It is crucial for evaluating the performance of the crater detection algorithm. Its primary function is to:
-   Compare a set of predicted crater detections (from `solution.csv` or similar) against a ground truth dataset.
-   Calculate a quantitative score based on a geometric distance metric (`dGA`) to determine the accuracy of the predicted ellipses relative to the actual craters.
-   Outputs the final score, allowing participants to gauge their solution's effectiveness.

### 4. `create_submission.py`
This script facilitates the **packaging of the solution** for official submission to the challenge. It automates the process of organizing all necessary files into a specific ZIP file structure required by the contest:
-   Collects the generated `solution.csv` from `crater_detector_final.py`.
-   Includes the `crater_detector_final.py` script itself.
-   Generates essential shell scripts (`train.sh` and `test.sh`) that define how the solution should be run for training (or rather, "no training" in this rule-based approach) and testing.
-   Creates a `README.md` specific to the submission, detailing the approach and usage.

This script ensures that the submission adheres to all formatting and content requirements, making it ready for evaluation.
